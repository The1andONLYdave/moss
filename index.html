<p>
    <b>Moss</b> is a <a href="http://conky.sourceforge.net/">Conky</a> like live
    wallpaper for android. It provides system statistics such as uptime, cpu usage,
    network usage, top processes, and battery level.  It is highly configurable.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Moss</b> ships with a few sample configurations. However you can write
    your own to customize your wallpaper.  Configuration tries to closely
    follow <a href="http://conky.sourceforge.net/">Conky's</a> syntax.
    Currently only a small subset of Conky's options are available.
</p>
<p>
    For example configurations please see <a href="samples.html">the samples</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Moss</b> is free and open source. You can download the code and build it
    yourself from <a href="http://www.github.com/teneighty/moss">Github</a>.
