title: Objects

<p>
    This section lists various objects you can use in the layout portion of
    your configuration file. Objects are enclosed in <code>${...}</code>. For
    example, to display the amount of disk usage on sdcard you could say,
    versus the amount of available space:

    <block><code><pre>
        FS: ${fs_used /sdcard} / ${fs_size /sdcard}
    </pre></code></block>

    You can get more ideas for layouts by looking at the <a href="samples.html">examples</a>.
